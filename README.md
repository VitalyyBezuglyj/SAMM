# Semantic Aware Map Metrics

This is the repository of the paper Reconstruction of 3D Semantic Map and Its Quality Estimation.

Here are several tools for calculating quality metrics to reconstruct 3D surface maps with/without semantics described in the paper. There are also several scripts for visualizing map quality.


Here is an example comparison of the quality of two different maps in the same places:
